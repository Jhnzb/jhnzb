1. Learning Curve: 

Scrum requires a significant mindset shift and learning curve for teams new to the framework, which can initially slow down productivity.

2. Dependency on Team Dynamics: 

Success in Scrum heavily relies on team dynamics and collaboration, which can be challenging to establish and maintain.

3. Lack of Prescription:

 Scrum provides guidelines rather than detailed instructions, which can lead to ambiguity and confusion, especially for inexperienced teams.

4. Time and Resource Intensive:

Implementing Scrum effectively requires dedicated time and resources for training, coaching, and adapting organizational processes.

5. Overemphasis on Sprint Goals: 

Focusing too much on sprint goals may lead to neglecting long-term strategic objectives.
