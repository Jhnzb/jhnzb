1. Resistance to Change:

 Resistance from stakeholders or team members to adopt Scrum practices can pose a significant threat to successful implementation.

2. Misalignment with Organizational Culture:

 If Scrum principles and values are not aligned with the organization's culture, it may face challenges in acceptance and sustainability.

3. Lack of Executive Support:

 Without strong support from executive leadership, implementing Scrum may face obstacles such as inadequate resources, conflicting priorities, and lack of organizational buy-in.

4. Competing Methodologies: 

Competition from alternative project management methodologies or frameworks may pose a threat to the widespread adoption of Scrum.

5. Poor Implementation:

 Poorly executed Scrum implementations, such as inconsistent application of practices or lack of understanding, can result in failed projects and disillusionment with the framework.
