Scrum is a framework used in agile project management, particularly in software development, to manage complex projects and deliver products incrementally. Here are some reasons why organisations use Scrum:

1. Flexibility: Scrum allows for flexibility and adaptation to changing requirements, enabling teams to respond quickly to customer feedback and market changes.Â 

2. Transparency: Scrum promotes transparency by providing regular opportunities for inspection and adaptation through its ceremonies like Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective.

3. Collaboration: Scrum emphasises collaboration among team members, stakeholders, and customers, fostering a shared understanding of project goals and priorities.

4. Iterative Development:Scrum divides the project into short iterations called Sprints, typically 2-4 weeks long, allowing for incremental development and frequent product releases.

5. Continuous Improvement: Scrum encourages continuous improvement through regular retrospectives, where teams reflect on their processes and identify areas for enhancement.

6. Empowerment:Scrum empowers self-organizing teams to make decisions and take ownership of their work, leading to higher motivation and productivity.

7. Risk Reduction: By delivering working increments of the product at the end of each Sprint, Scrum helps to mitigate project risks and validate assumptions early in the development process.Overall, organizations use Scrum to improve productivity, collaboration, and the ability to deliver valuable products that meet customer needs.
