Obsidian app is mostly used when we are writing a journal, project and task management and knowledge base creation. Yes there are some other apps(like bear, apple notes, notion ever notes  e.t.c) which we used for the above purpose but obsidian comes with some  extra  features that those apps don't have.These are the features which makes it valunerable than others thats why we prefer to [[use obsidian app]]
